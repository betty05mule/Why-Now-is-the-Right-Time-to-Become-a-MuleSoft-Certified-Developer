Salesforce completed its acquisition of MuleSoft, the world’s leading platform for application networks, in May of last year. A great fit for the Salesforce ecosystem, MuleSoft’s mission is to connect any application, data, and device by building innovative products that drive customers’ success. Why Now is the Right Time to Become a MuleSoft Certified Developer 1  MuleSoft’s software platform seamlessly connects nearly every technology in one uniform way. It moves away from custom code and instead gathers data by way of APIs and joins it to external systems and applications. This lets its users secure and manage their data flow throughout systems and networks enterprise-wide.  Sheryl Kingstone, Research Director of451 Research, shared that Salesforce’s purchase of MuleSoft puts the customer “right at the heart of digital transformation.” She said, “Many companies are still lagging due to the difficulty in integrating legacy infrastructure, automating manual and paper-based processes, and managing data growth.
